# Semantic Segmentation
The binary segmentation task consists of predicting the disease area on the leaves. See info on Kaggle [Page](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fakhrealam9537/leaf-disease-segmentation-dataset). The final predictions on the best trained model versus true masks are displayed in the [notebook](https://github.com/Venzel13/Semantic_Segmentation/blob/main/plot_result.ipynb)
